# Rethinking Decentralisation

In late 2016 was invited my Mozilla's OpenIOT Studio to think about Decentralisation, particularly in rural environments.

But first let's start from the basics...

#### Who I am and what I'm interested in

I'm a creative technologist. I come from an arts background, I'm self taught techy who has always been interested in how things work. I'm a really good google-until-I-find-the-solution maker.

I believe anyone can make things with technology with the right guides and enough confidence. I spend a lot of my time thinking about this.

I worked within a [technology charity](http://www.raspberrypi.org) over 3 years before going back into the freelance world late 2016 to have the opportunity to take part in projects like this one with Mozilla's OpenIOT Studio. Within this role I got to travel the world attending conferences and festivals where people discussed new technology and the power of making. I also designed and ran workshops, outreach and longer form educational programmes.

I also make tech with [The Pi Hut](http://www.thepihut.com), particularly focusing on making add-on boards for people new to making. Our aim is for our boards to do one thing well.

Before this I ran a Arts and Tech venue in Norwich called Soup Lab.

**Some things I’m generally interested in right now:**
*  a friendly framework/language to talk about IoT with non-techies
* making IoT things with non-techies
* why/how/is the internet important to people with low/no connectivity
* does IoT widen the divide between those with good connectivity and those without (if so, how do we deal with this?)

**Why?** Because if we want to make tech for everyone, then we need to include them in the progress.

#### Talking about IoT & what is Decentralisation?

> The Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices … embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data.

 Makes sense to be, but would be difficult to explain to my grandma. How about...

 > Small computers that talk to each other.
