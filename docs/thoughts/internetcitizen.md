# Welcome to the Internet

**Brief**: To explore handle(s) as an embodied exchange between human and object, in relation to a specific task and for a particular context.

**Intent/Audience**: To help new internet users handle online interactions. To make conversation online to be more accessible. To remind existing users.

**Disclaimer**: This is not a guide to start using the internet, it's a nudge to be a better internet citizen.

**Technology**: A browser plug-in (add-on) to guide you through online interactions.

## Challenge

Users can find interacting with others online a confusing experience. Social media and comment sections can sometimes be unpleasant places. 

Although we cannot control how others act online, we can try and aid understanding and practice good etiquette in an attempt to make the internet a nicer place. We can also offer tips for new users to become more resilient when they do encounter negative behaviour online.



*misunderstanding*

* Users do not read carefully.
* Users are not aware of a wider context.
* Users do not research the author of whatever they are responding to, so cannot make a judgement on their authority on the subject.
* It is hard to convey a tone, so comments can be read in multiple ways (sometimes depending on the reader's mood)

*different language*
* Words mean different things in different contexts.
* Users use images as shorthand (memes).
* Users use emojis to signify a tone or feeling.

*unkindness*
* Users are sometimes rude online.
* Users are sometimes unhelpful online.
* Users are sometimes not thoughtful online.
