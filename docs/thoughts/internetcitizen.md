# Welcome to the Internet

**Brief**: To explore handle(s) as an embodied exchange between human and object, in relation to a specific task and for a particular context.

**Intent/Audience**: To help new internet users handle online interactions. To make conversation online to be more accessible. To remind existing users.

**Disclaimer**: This is not a guide to start using the internet, it's a nudge to be a better internet citizen.

**Technology**: A browser plug-in (add-on) to guide you through online interactions.

## Challenge

Users can find interacting with others online a confusing experience. Social media and comment sections can sometimes be unpleasant places.

*misunderstanding*

* Users do not read carefully.
* Users are not aware of a wider context.
* Users do not research the author of whatever they are responding to, so cannot make a judgement on their authority on the subject.
* It is hard to convey a tone, so comments can be read in multiple ways (sometimes depending on the reader's mood)

*different language*
* Words mean different things in different contexts.
* Users use images as shorthand (memes).
* Users use emojis to signify a tone or feeling.

*unkindness*
* Users are sometimes rude online.
* Users are sometimes unhelpful online.
* Users are sometimes not thoughtful online.

## Scenarios

## Initial Ideas
* Check list of good practice before posting
``` 
> Have you read the content fully?
> Do you know who the author is?
> Has the author asked for feedback or advice?
``` 
* Quick glossary of acronyms and emoji (and memes?)
