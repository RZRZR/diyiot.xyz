# Hacking your Solar Controller

I use Tracer BN Solar Controllers, simply because they were recommended to me for my first van and I never had a problem with them.

## Quick final note on what's to come:

A quick overview of what Open Hardware is, and how my building and documenting will work.

I will be updating build sections as I go. Some of be very focused on IoT (e.g. hacked Solar Monitor, and IoT Fridge) and some wont have any (cutting list for the cabinets).

A lot of what I will be documenting I wont have worked out on totally my own. Much of the software will have been based on projects which already exist and I may have been signposted to particular bits of hardware by others who have tried out things before me. One of the major joys of the internet is the mass exchange of knowledge, we no longer have to reinvent the wheel over and over. Knowing how to search through and digest massive amounts of information is now a more daunting task than finding it in the first place. I will endeavour to link back to original sources whenever I am able and will try and remember to explain *how* I found information too.
